## Question/need:

- What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?

The purpose of this analysis is  to give the WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) more information about the most appropriate subway stations in New York City by using MTA Turnstile data, so they can determine which days and locations for their street teams to collect most email addresses and people who sing up are sent free tickets to attend the WTWY summer gala event.

The WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) are priority beneficiaries for their annual fund raising event to support women, as well as individuals interested in raising awareness and increasing women's participation in technology.

- If modeling, what will you predict as your target?

There is no modeling in this project.

## Tools:

By using Pandas, Numpy and seaborn.

- Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?
