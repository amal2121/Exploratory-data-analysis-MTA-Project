### Exploratory Data Analysis of MTA Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York

The purpose of this analysis is to give the WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) more information about the top five traffic subway stations in New York City by using MTA Turnstile data, so they can determine which stations are the busiest for their street teams to collect most email addresses and people who sing up are sent free tickets to attend the WTWY summer gala event. That will help the WomenTechWomenYes(WTWY) to raise thier annual fund to support thier event.
