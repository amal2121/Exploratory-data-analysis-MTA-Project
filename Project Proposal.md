# EDA for MTA Project WTWY

## Question/need:
### What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?

The purpose of this analysis is to give the WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) more information about the top five traffic subway stations in New York City by using MTA Turnstile data, so they can determine which stations are the busiest for their street teams to collect most email addresses and people who sing up are sent free tickets to attend the WTWY summer gala event.

### Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?

The WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) are priority beneficiaries for their annual fund raising event to support thier event.
